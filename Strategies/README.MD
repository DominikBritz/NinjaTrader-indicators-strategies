# Strategies

I tested a lot of automated strategies, but none of them worked consistently. However, there is some nice stuff in the files like buttons to enable/disable trading, put the SL under the last bar, move the SL to breakeven after a number of ticks and so on. Hence I've published the files here, maybe someone finds it useful.
